## Running the Code
Simply run the code the same as `Project 6: Action!`. You will see instead of the "Extra Credit" section we have an "Additional Features" section. Here you can enable/disable different features in real time. Note that checking/unchecking the Bezier Curve box will simply play/pause the movement, not restart it.

## Known Bugs
At the end of the defined Bezier Curve path, the code stops generating points and the screen goes black (the camera moves to an undefined location).
